# cardekho_price_prediction
- This project leverages the CarDekho used car dataset to explore and evaluate various regression models available in Scikit-learn for predicting car prices. The primary objective was to identify the most suitable regression algorithm for this problem through systematic experimentation and performance comparison.

- Before proceeding to model development, significant time was dedicated to understanding the problem statement, identifying it as a supervised regression task, and conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the dataset for modeling. Establishing this strong foundation ensured a structured and reliable modeling process, adhering to best practices in machine learning rather than adopting a trial-and-error approach.

- Multiple regression models were implemented and evaluated to compare their performance using appropriate metrics. This hands-on experimentation provided deeper insights into model behavior, strengths, and limitations in real-world scenarios.

- This repository documents the methodology, findings, and key learnings from the project. It played a significant role in strengthening my understanding of machine learning fundamentals and served as a stepping stone toward more advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence.
